Pure Grids consist of two types of classes: the grid class (pure-g) and unit classes (pure-u or pure-u-*)
The widths of the units are fractions
Units have various class names that represent their widths. For example, pure-u-1-2 has a width of 50%, whereas pure-u-1-5 would have a width of 20%.
All child elements of a grid must be units
Child elements contained within an element with a pure-g classname</p></div>

All child elements of a grid must be units
Child elements contained within an element with a pure-g classname must be a grid unit with a pure-u or pure-u-* classname.
Content goes inside grid units
All content which is visible to people needs to be contained inside a grid unit. This ensures that the content will be rendered properly.</p></div>
